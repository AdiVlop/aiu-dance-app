-- 1. È˜terge toate policies existente pentru a Ã®ncepe curat
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view active courses" ON courses;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Instructors can manage their courses" ON courses;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own wallet" ON wallets;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own wallet" ON wallets;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all wallets" ON wallets;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own transactions" ON wallet_transactions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all transactions" ON wallet_transactions;

-- 2. CreeazÄƒ policies noi care permit adminului sÄƒ vadÄƒ totul
-- Policies pentru profiles
CREATE POLICY "Admins can do everything on profiles" ON profiles
  FOR ALL USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles 
      WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
    )
  );

-- Policies pentru courses
CREATE POLICY "Admins can do everything on courses" ON courses
  FOR ALL USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles 
      WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
    )
  );

-- Policies pentru wallets
CREATE POLICY "Admins can do everything on wallets" ON wallets
  FOR ALL USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles 
      WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
    )
  );

-- Policies pentru wallet_transactions
CREATE POLICY "Admins can do everything on wallet_transactions" ON wallet_transactions
  FOR ALL USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles 
      WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
    )
  );

-- 3. AdaugÄƒ È™i policies pentru utilizatori normali (opÈ›ional)
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile" ON profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile" ON profiles
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- âœ… GATA! Acum adminul poate vedea toate datele
